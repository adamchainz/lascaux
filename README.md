### Installation

**Setting up Python and OpenCV**

This is by far the biggest hassle. Once it is done, however, it never needs to
be done again. These instructions work on Ubuntu 12.04. Youâ€™ll probably need to
modify them to suit your particular environment. These directions also assume
you have [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
setup as well.

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv printmatic
$ pip install numpy
$ sudo apt-get install cmake libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev \
  libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libamd2.2.0 libblas3gf libc6 libgcc1 \
  libgfortran3 liblapack3gf libumfpack5.4.0 libstdc++6 build-essential \
  gfortran libatlas-dev libatlas-base-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev libjpeg-dev \
  libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev
$ wget -O opencv-2.4.9.zip http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/opencvlibrary/opencv-unix/2.4.9/opencv-2.4.9.zip?r=http%3A%2F%2Fopencv.org%2Fdownloads.html&ts=1403558615&use_mirror=softlayer-dal
$ mkdir src && mv opencv-2.4.9.zip src && cd src
$ unzip opencv-2.4.9.zip
$ cd opencv-2.4.5/
$ mkdir release
$ cd release
$ cmake -DMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$VIRTUAL_ENV/local/ \
  -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python \
  -DPYTHON_PACKAGES_PATH=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages \
  -DINSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON ..
$ make -j8 # Set the number here to the number of processing cores you have
$ make install
```

### Mac install

#### Make a virtual environment

    $ mkvirtualenv printmatic

#### Install the required libraries

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Install OpenCV

This is a hassle. Maybe use brew?

I already had OpenCV installed, and had to copy `cv2.so` to my virtualenv's
`site-packages`. This probably can be dealt with better by some `PATH`
manuvering.

#### Install Cairo

Getting Cairo set up has been a major pain. The most common problems are caused
by it simply not being found. Try:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/X11/lib/pkgconfig

(or just add it right to your `PATH`)

On Ubuntu you should be able to get libcairo and the appropriate header files thusly:

```bash 
$ sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
```

### Running the app

    $ python app.py

### Making a request

``` python
>>> import requests
>>> params = {
              'center': [-87.69358, 41.786456],
              'dimensions': [3000, 5000],
              'zoom': 17
            }
# You can also optionally include LocalData survey info
>>> params['survey'] = '<survey UUID>',
>>> params['survey_filter'] = 'Is-property-vacant'
>>> params['survey_filter_value'] = 'Yes'
>>> r = requests.get('http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/print/', params=params)
>>> with open('test.pdf', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(r.content)
```

That should give you a file called ``test.pdf`` in your current working directory
