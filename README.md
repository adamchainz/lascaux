### Installation

**Setting up Python and OpenCV**

This is by far the biggest hassle. Once it is done, however, it never needs to
be done again. These instructions work on Ubuntu 12.04. Youâ€™ll probably need to
modify them to suit your particular environment. These directions also assume
you have [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
setup as well.

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv printmatic
$ pip install numpy
$ sudo apt-get install cmake libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev \
  libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libamd2.2.0 libblas3gf libc6 libgcc1 \
  libgfortran3 liblapack3gf libumfpack5.4.0 libstdc++6 build-essential \
  gfortran libatlas-dev libatlas-base-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev libjpeg-dev \
  libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev
$ wget -O opencv-2.4.9.zip http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/opencvlibrary/opencv-unix/2.4.9/opencv-2.4.9.zip?r=http%3A%2F%2Fopencv.org%2Fdownloads.html&ts=1403558615&use_mirror=softlayer-dal
$ mkdir src && mv opencv-2.4.9.zip src && cd src
$ unzip opencv-2.4.9.zip
$ cd opencv-2.4.5/
$ mkdir release
$ cd release
$ cmake -DMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$VIRTUAL_ENV/local/ \
  -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python \
  -DPYTHON_PACKAGES_PATH=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages \
  -DINSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON ..
$ make -j8 # Set the number here to the number of processing cores you have
$ make install
```

### Mac install

#### Make a virtual environment

    $ mkvirtualenv printmatic

#### Install the required libraries

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Install OpenCV

This is a hassle. Maybe use brew?

I already had OpenCV installed, and had to copy `cv2.so` to my virtualenv's
`site-packages`. This probably can be dealt with better by some `PATH`
manuvering.

#### Install Cairo

Getting Cairo set up has been a major pain. The most common problems are caused
by it simply not being found. Try:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/X11/lib/pkgconfig

(or just add it right to your `PATH`)

#### Install py2cairo

It seems like you have to do this by hand now:

    curl http://cairographics.org/releases/py2cairo-1.10.0.tar.bz2 > py2cairo.tar.bz2
    tar -xvf py2cairo.tar.bz2
    ./waf configure --prefix=FULL_PATH_TO_VIRTUALENV
    ./waf build
    ./waf install

### Running the app

    $ python app.py
